## Auto Tunnel - A utility that tries to keep a vpn tunnel established

Run the installer, modify the config, enjoy an always-connected vpn tunnel

I run a vm on my network that acts as a gateway for the vpn tunnel. This eliminates the need for any vpn client apps and I can access the tunnel from any node on my network. These are the scripts I've been using and they work well for me, but could be drastically improved.


Requirements (this is what I tested on): 
	
	Ubuntu Linux 10.04 (2.6.32-24-server)
	vpnc 0.5.3 (if you need it - 'sudo apt-get install vpnc')
	access to an ipsec endpoint


Install:

** perform these steps as root ('sudo -i')

1 - Change launcher perms 'chmod 755 install.sh'

2 - Run the installer './install.sh'

3 - Modify the configuration 'sudo vi /etc/auto_tunnel.conf' (always backup the originals first)

4 - Modify /opt/apps/auto_tunnel/link_checker.sh and replace the value for ipaddr with an address available on the destination network. Make sure that you can receive ping responses from this address.


Optional: Act as a gateway and route traffic from other nodes through this tunnel

1 - add routes to this host on your routers for the netblocks you want to access via the tunnel

2 - enable forwarding via iptables (modify examples/iptables.sav and append it to your /etc/iptables.sav)
